"""
Async source transformer for the WASM (Pyodide) runner.

Web VPython programs call ``rate()`` (and ``scene.waitfor()`` /
``get_library()``) as if they were ordinary blocking functions. In the browser
these are actually asynchronous, so the runner executes the whole program with
Pyodide's ``runPythonAsync``, which permits top-level ``await``. The old runner
used regex substitution to insert ``await`` before each ``rate(`` — but that
produces ``await`` inside a plain ``def``, which is a SyntaxError
(GitHub issue #1).

This module uses the AST to *decide* what to change, then applies minimal
textual insertions (``async `` / ``await ``) at the exact source positions:

  * Calls to the known-async primitives (``rate``, ``get_library``,
    ``*.waitfor``) get ``await`` inserted before them.
  * Any function whose body then contains an ``await`` is promoted to
    ``async def``.
  * Calls to a now-async user function get ``await`` inserted too, which can
    promote their callers in turn. This propagates to a fixpoint so
    arbitrarily deep call chains work.

Insertions never add or remove lines, so line numbers, comments, and blank
lines are preserved exactly — error tracebacks still point at the user's
original lines. (An ``ast.unparse`` round-trip would discard all of that.)

The transform is pure standard-library (only ``ast``) so it can be unit-tested
outside Pyodide. It must not import anything from the rest of the ``vpython``
package (whose ``__init__`` pulls in ``js``).

Known limitations (documented, matching the previous behavior):
  * ``rate()`` inside a ``lambda`` or a comprehension cannot be fixed (those
    cannot be async). Such calls are left untouched.
  * A user function passed by reference as an event callback
    (``scene.bind('mousedown', f)``) is promoted to ``async`` if it contains
    ``rate()``, but the binding site is not awaited. Event handlers that loop
    with ``rate()`` remain an unsupported edge case.
